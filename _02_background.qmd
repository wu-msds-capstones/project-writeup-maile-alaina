# Background 
Generative AI (GAI) is revolutionizing healthcare by offering innovative solutions for diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. This advanced form of artificial intelligence enhances healthcare delivery by generating new data and insights, providing a versatile tool for various applications including text, images, audio, and video . However, its integration into healthcare systems raises questions about its benefits, challenges, and practical applications .
In a comprehensive scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, researchers searched databases like Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus, ultimately including 109 articles from an initial pool of 1406 . The study identified nine prominent GAI models, with ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing AI being the most frequently utilized in healthcare settings .
Generative AI has several key applications in healthcare. It supports clinical decision-making by aiding in the diagnosis and prediction of diseases, triage, treatment strategy formulation, and offering management advice . It also plays a vital role in medical education by providing insights on health conditions, designing exam questions, producing medical articles, and supporting interactive learning tools for medical students . Additionally, GAI streamlines clinical documentation by summarizing patient problems, creating discharge summaries, and generating healthcare-related text and reports .
The benefits of generative AI in healthcare are significant. It improves diagnosis accuracy, reduces human error, and efficiently analyzes symptoms to identify treatment options . GAI provides rapid access to valuable insights, offers high concordance rates with specialists' recommendations, and enhances patient engagement through personalized care . It also supports medical research and education by assisting in article drafting and clinical trial matching, promoting a better understanding of complex medical concepts . Furthermore, GAI offers substantial time and cost savings compared to traditional evaluations, reducing the workload for medical professionals .
However, generative AI in healthcare also faces several challenges. While it cannot replace human doctors or account for individual patient preferences, it may exhibit biases and variability in human adjudication, leading to lower accuracy in some diagnoses and treatment recommendations . Ethical considerations and data privacy issues are also significant, with risks of AI generating inaccurate or biased information . Additionally, patients may lack confidence in AI accuracy, necessitating frequent human oversight and modifications . Continuous validation and updating are necessary to maintain performance and reliability, and there is a need for specific training and re-training of AI models in various medical contexts .
Generative AI has also shown promise in remote patient monitoring (RPM) telehealth solutions. Companies like Andor Health and Babylon Health, as well as healthcare professionals such as Dr. Josh Tamayo-Sarver, utilize ChatGPT to enhance virtual health interactions, patient communication, and routine healthcare tasks . ChatGPT answers patient questions, monitors symptoms, provides personalized health education, offers emotional support, and overcomes language barriers, making healthcare more accessible and efficient . Its integration into telemedicine offers enhanced patient engagement, streamlined workflows, expanded accessibility, cost savings, and data-driven insights .
Despite its benefits, concerns about accuracy, reliability, lack of human judgment, and patient privacy need addressing . Best practices for implementing GAI in healthcare include training and fine-tuning AI models, ensuring human oversight, adhering to regulatory compliance, conducting thorough testing, and continuous improvement based on feedback .
For readers unfamiliar with this area, some key vocabulary and concepts are important to grasp:
Generative AI: A type of artificial intelligence that generates new data based on patterns from existing data. It is different from other AI systems that might only classify or predict based on provided inputs.
Diagnostic Accuracy: A measure of how correctly a diagnostic tool identifies or predicts a medical condition compared to a reference standard.
Healthcare Systems Integration: The process of incorporating new technologies, such as AI, into existing healthcare frameworks.
Our research is situated within the broader context of ongoing efforts to integrate AI into healthcare. The current state of research shows a growing interest in leveraging AI for diagnostics, but there is still much to learn about its practical implications and effectiveness. By evaluating the performance of generative AI in this context, we aim to contribute valuable insights that could inform future developments and enhance the role of AI in healthcare diagnostics.
