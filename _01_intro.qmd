# Introduction

One of the most promising developments in this field is generative AI, a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new data based on patterns learned from existing datasets. Generative AI can analyze large volumes of data quickly and identify patterns that may be difficult for human clinicians to discern. This capability holds the potential to revolutionize the diagnostic process, making it faster, more consistent, and potentially more accurate.

Despite its potential, the integration of generative AI into healthcare raises critical questions. Key among these is how the diagnoses generated by AI compare to those made by human clinicians when presented with identical symptoms. Can generative AI achieve the level of accuracy required for clinical use? What are the strengths and limitations of AI in this context?

This capstone project aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of generative AI, specifically ChatGPT, in a telehealth setting. By comparing the AI-generated diagnoses with those provided by human clinicians, we seek to determine the feasibility of using AI for accurate medical diagnoses. Additionally, this study explores the potential impact of generative AI on improving diagnostic processes and patient outcomes.

To achieve these objectives, we developed a methodology involving a dataset licensed from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and sourced from Kaggle, which contains over one hundred symptoms associated with various diagnoses. Using ChatGPT to simulate a telehealth doctor, we employed multiple API calls, presenting it with randomized symptom data and recording its diagnostic predictions. These predictions were then compared to the actual diagnoses in the dataset to assess accuracy.

Our research is structured as follows: We begin with a review of the current state of generative AI in healthcare, highlighting its applications, benefits, and challenges. Next, we describe our methodology in detail, including data collection, model selection, and statistical analysis. We then present our results, followed by a discussion of the implications, limitations, and potential future directions for research. Finally, we summarize our findings and their significance for the future of AI in healthcare.

Through this investigation, we aim to contribute valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of generative AI in healthcare, paving the way for future advancements and applications in this critical field.
